# Input Block

The Input block provides a basic field for text entry in forms, using an `<input>` element. It supports multiple input types, such as text, email, URL, and number, enabling you to define the expected format for user data.

To add a Input block, create a new form and open the Block Inserter tool. Use the search bar to find the Input block and click on its icon to insert it into the editor.

You can also choose the Input block from the "Block Inserter" (+) pop-up window when you click on the (+) sign.
