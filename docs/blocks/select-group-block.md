# Select Group Block

Use the Select Group block to organize multiple [Option](select-option-block.md) blocks under a shared label. This helps group related choices together, making your form clearer and easier for users to navigate.

To add a Select Group block, create a new form and open the Block Inserter tool. Use the search bar to find the Select Group block and click on its icon to insert it into the editor.

You can also choose the Select Group block from the "Block Inserter" (+) pop-up window when you click on the (+) sign.
