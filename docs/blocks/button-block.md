# Button Block

The Button block adds a clickable button to your form, allowing users to submit or reset the information they have entered. It generates a `<button>` element and provides options to set its action as either "submit" or "reset," making it an essential component for form functionality.

To add a Button block, create a new form and open the Block Inserter tool. Use the search bar to find the Button block and click on its icon to insert it into the editor.

You can also choose the Button block from the "Block Inserter" (+) pop-up window when you click on the (+) sign.
