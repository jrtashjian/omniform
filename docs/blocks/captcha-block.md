# Captcha Block

Add an extra layer of form protection against spam.

To add a Captcha block, create a new form and open the Block Inserter tool. Use the search bar to find the Captcha block and click on its icon to insert it into the editor.

You can also choose the Captcha block from the "Block Inserter" (+) pop-up window when you click on the (+) sign.

## Block Settings

The Captcha block supports service, theme, and size attributes. It does not support multiple instances per form. See [omniform.prepareFormElementForSubmission](../hooks/js-hooks.md) for validation hooks.
