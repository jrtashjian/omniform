# Fieldset Block

Use the Fieldset block to group related form controls, such as [Input](input-block.md), [Textarea](textarea-block.md), and [Select](select-block.md) blocks, within a single `<fieldset>` element. This improves form organization and accessibility by clearly associating related fields, making it easier for users to understand and navigate grouped inputs.

To add a Fieldset block, create a new form and open the Block Inserter tool. Use the search bar to find the Fieldset block and click on its icon to insert it into the editor.

You can also choose the Fieldset block from the "Block Inserter" (+) pop-up window when you click on the (+) sign.
